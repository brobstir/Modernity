        An Analysis of Power
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Power
    </h2>
        <p>
            <strong><em>Power resides where it is perceived to reside.</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no concreteness in the realm of control.
            In oligarchies, aristocracies, and monarchies this may seem obvious.
            When examined closely, <strong>nothing </strong> truly distinguishes the few in power from those that they govern.
            They simply wear finer clothes and pretend as though they are entitled to their oppressive behaviors.
            Every nation, organization, and institution which falls into the categories above will ultimately crumble, as the people inevitably realize that they have no power.
            The people recognize the submissive state that they are in, and their innate desire for control compells them to rebel against those above them.
            However they do not realize that this is unnecessary, the only thing required of them to obtain their freedom is that they realize one crucial truth.
            The only thing that differentiates those in power from all others is the collective belief that those in power are somehow different.
            That they do not think the same as the rest of us.
            That they do not bleed the same blood as the rest of us.
            By realizing this truth, a society can simply return to a state of true self-governence in which no person holds power over another.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><em>Because power is a conception.</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Democracies give the appearance of this ideal society.
            They encourage nationalism and broad participation, and therefore the image that the governed are in fact the governors.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><em>But this is all an illusion.</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The orchestrators of democracy realized that the explicit declaration of one's power only causes others to become envious of that power.
            This envy will eventually cause a society to realize the truth, that power is conceived, and that therefore they are just as capable of being in power as those who already have it.
            The solution to this is for those in power to hide that fact from society.
            However this is not possible because if power is only fabricated by the beliefs of society, then one's own power cannot exist without society's creation of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><em>This is the genius of democracy.</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Democracy creates the illuion that the people are in control.</strong>
            This illusion is easily accepted because it is so appealing to society.
            After all, who would question their own sovereignty?
            Once this illusion is created, the politicians put in power "by the people" continue to emphasize that their power is reliant on the approval of the people.
            This narrative serves to reinforce the illusion, thereby allowing those truly in power to operate in the shadows.
            Of course the illusion only works if proof of it is presented.
            So laws are created by the elected officials, impeachment trials remove those who did not "serve the people", and criticism of the established government goes unpunished.
            All of these mechanisms are carried out by politicians who were elected by the people, but who decides which politicians will run for office?
            Who decides which candidates will receive the most media attention for their campaign?
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><em>The true governors of society.</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            These governors live and work in the shadows relying on their puppets, who were of course elected by the people, to maintain the illusion that provides their safety.
            These governors are the true architects of the world.
            Their actions are what in fact rule the entirety of humanity itself, the "victories" of societal-led movements (women's suffrage, civil rights, the right to 'privacy') are merely distractions to keep society entertained and therefore oblivious to the truth.
            <strong>Once perpetuated for centuries, this illusion is so powerful that it can not be abandoned, to the point where even world-changing events are perceived as pure chance. </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, the elderly population becomes so large that entitlement programs can not be fufilled.
            This causes unrest in younger generations as more of their pay check must be taken to uphold these obligations.
            The elderly become uneasy because the finances they were promised are no longer something to rely on.
            This unrest threatens the established order, but the solution is clear.
            Eliminate the root of the problem, too many old people.
            A virus that only affects the elderly must be introduced, however the virus must spread easily and should ideally have an asymptomatic period, so that measures to prevent the spread occur too late.
            This virus is engineered in a foreign laboratory, but its release is disguised as an accident.
            Merely caused by a man eating soup made with a bat who happened to have this 'mutated' virus.
            The people accept this lie that the release of a bioengineered virus from a laboratory must have been caused by bat soup, after all the people have the power and would never allow this.
        </p>
        <p>
            The virus does exactly as intended, eliminating a problem that economists had been pointing out for decades.
            A problem that would have caused the people to question the abilities of the government, which if analyzed too closely, can be observed to be merely a show, a smoke screen.
            But the people accept that this brutal, but perfect, solution was caused by a one-in-a-trillion mutation, and not the meticulous efforts of the powerful from the shadows.
            Because the acceptance of that lie upholds the illusion that the people are in control, and <strong> the illusion must be reality because it has been around for so long.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This is how democracies maintain the same conditions as tyrannical governments for far longer than would otherwise be possible.
        </p>
    <h3>
        The Continuation of the Illusion
    </h3>
        <p>
            The maintainence of the illusion can be broken down into several pillars.
            Together these pillars hold the illusion upright.
            Without them it would crumble, revealing what lies behind.
